# nba-verdict
A simple application built using Flask to give me some experience with APIs, Routing, and Pandas. Goal is to make it easier to see core stats that are relevant to an NBA player's place in all-time debates. 

# Issues (WIP)
1. `nba_api` only has year-by-year data back until 1996, so unable to get championships before then
2. The post request can be more efficient
3. Needs styling

# To get this working, just ...
1. `git clone https://github.com/ankithkanderi24/nba-verdict.git`
2. Change into project directory, and`python3 -m venv myenv`
3. Then, `source myenv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install flask`
5. `pip install nba_api`

Have fun! You should be all set! 🏀🏀🏀🏀

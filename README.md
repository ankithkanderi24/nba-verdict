# nba-verdict
A simple application to make it easier to reach a definitive verdict on an NBA player's all-time status! Done in an effort to improve my skills with APIs, Pandas, and Routing with a project I'm passionate about.

# Issues (WIP)
1. `nba_api` only has year-by-year data back until 1996, so unable to get championships before then
2. The post request can be more efficient
3. Needs styling

# To get this working, just ...
1. `git clone https://github.com/ankithkanderi24/nba-verdict.git`
2. Change into project directory, and`python3 -m venv myenv`
3. Then, `source myenv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install flask`
5. `pip install nba_api`

Have fun! You should be all set! 🏀🏀🏀🏀
